- we can fire SQL queries with help of JDBC template
- to fire queries it need datasource object 
- datasource object is created from DataSource interface
- DriverManagerDataSource is implementation class for DataSource interface
- Since we can pass child Class object where we need to pass parent class object, So basically we will inject object of DriverManagerDataSource class to datasource properties of JDBC template
- information needed to be passed when creating object of DriverManagerDataSource are : driverClassName; url ( protocol:sub-protocol:location); username ; password
- with above info provided to DriverManagerDataSource, then object of DriverManagerDataSource can be injected to datasource properties.
- we can then prepare its object in JDBC template and then fire queries as requried.
