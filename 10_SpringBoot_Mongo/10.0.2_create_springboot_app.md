# Creating Springboot app with mongodb

- check [here] to get basic understanding of SpringBoot MVC flow

- **create model:**
  - this will kind of represent schema of collection
  - create model package and Student class and add properties to it. 

- next we **create repository layer:** 
  - this is for providing methods to do operations in database
  - https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/repository/MongoRepository.html
  - MongoRepository provides all the necessary methods which help to create a CRUD application and it also supports the custom derived query methods.
  - **MongoRepository<T,ID>**
  - T: Domain type that repository manages (Generally the Entity/Model class name)
    ID: Type of the id of the entity that repository manages (Generally the wrapper class of your @Id that is created inside the Entity/Model class)
  - created src/main/java/repo/StudentRepository.java


- next we create controller:
  - added studentRepository object and autowired it to  StudentRepository
  - added mapping for request 
  - added two methods - one to add student and other to get all students 

- added mongo specific properties in application properties
