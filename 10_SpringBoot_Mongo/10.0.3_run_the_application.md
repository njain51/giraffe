# Run the application

- run the application:

- we will use postman to add records to database:
- latest code here: https://github.com/njain51/springboot-mongo-sample
  - need to debug why calls are not working... 
  - package created: controller, model etc were outside the base package. Moved package  to  `com.njain51.demo.springbootmongosample` and calls to rest api url working now.

- Testing:
- send some post requests with json data to store to students collections( it will automatically be created)
```text
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8081/student' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw ' {
     "id":"1",
     "name":"nitin",
     "city":"varanasi",
     "college":"work"
 }'
```
 
output:
```json
[
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "jia",
        "city": "ghaziabad",
        "college": "na"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "myra",
        "city": "singapore",
        "college": "morrisville"
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "nitin",
        "city": "varanasi",
        "college": "work"
    }
]
```

- checking same query in database:
```sql
> use mydb
switched to db mydb
> show collections
student
> db.student.find()
{ "_id" : 1, "name" : "nitin", "city" : "varanasi", "college" : "hbti", "_class" : "com.njain51.demo.springbootmongosample.model.Student" }
{ "_id" : 2, "name" : "myra", "city" : "ghaziabad", "college" : "morrisville", "_class" : "com.njain51.demo.springbootmongosample.model.Student" }
{ "_id" : 3, "name" : "jia", "city" : "ghaziabad", "college" : "na", "_class" : "com.njain51.demo.springbootmongosample.model.Student" }
>

```
