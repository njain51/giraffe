**Summary**:

PagingAndSortingRepository extends CrudRepository

JpaRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository

- The PagingAndSortingRepository provides additional methods to retrieve entities using pagination and sorting.

- Finally the JpaRepository add some more functionality that is specific to JPA.
