### Request/Response Flow
- client will send request to server
- client: mobile, browser etc.
- server : request will be received by controller - which is also called Presentation layer
- they can forward request to Service Layer / Business Layer
- Main work is done by Service Layer
- Service Layer will send or receive data from Repository via DAO layer
- So DAO layer will connect to Repository  and make data available to Service Layer.
- once request is completed by Service Layer, response is sent back to Presentation Layer or Controller
- Controller will send the response back to the client
