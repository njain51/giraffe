#### Dependency Injection using Setter methods

Here is the content of Cars.java file -

```java
package com.abc;

public class Cars {
   private Tyre tyre;
 
   public void setTyre(Tyre tyre) {
      System.out.println("Inside setTyre." );
      this.tyre = tyre;
   }
  
   public Tyre getTyre() {
      return tyre;
   }
   public void tyreCheck() {
      tyre.checkTyre();
   }
}
```

- Here you need to check the naming convention of the setter methods. To set a variable tyre we are using setTyre() method which is very similar to Java POJO classes. Let us create the content of another dependent class file Tyre.java -

```java
package com.abc;

public class Tyre {
   public Tyre(){
      System.out.println("Inside Tyre constructor." );
   }
   public void checkTyre() {
      System.out.println("Inside checkTyre." );
   }
}
```
Following is the content of the CarsExample.java file -

```java
package com.abc;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class CarsExample {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");

      Cars cr = (Cars) context.getBean("cars");
      cr.tyreCheck();
   }
}
```

Following is the configuration file Beans.xml which has configuration for the setter-based injection -
```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">
  
   
  		      <!-- Definition for cars bean -->
   <bean id = "cars" class = "com.abc.Cars">
       <property name = "tyre" ref = "tyre"/>   
       <!-- because of this property tag, setter method will be called for cars  -->
   </bean>

   <!-- Definition for tyre bean -->
   <bean id = "tyre" class = "com.abc.Tyre"></bean>
   
   
</beans>

```

- You should note the difference in Beans.xml file defined in the constructor-based injection and the setter-based injection. The only difference is inside the <bean> element where we have used** "constructor-arg" tags for constructor-based injection and "property" tags for setter-based injection**.
- **The second important point to note is that in case you are passing a reference to an object, you need to use ref attribute of <property> tag and if you are passing a value directly then you should use value attribute.**
- Once you are done creating the source and bean configuration files, let us run the application. If everything is fine with your application, this
  will print the following message -

```
Inside Tyre  constructor.
Inside setTyre.
Inside checkTyre.

```

If we additionally want to invoke Cars Constructor add following :

```
 public Cars(Tyre tyre1) {
  System.out.println("Inside Cars Constructor");
  this.tyre=tyre1;
}
```
then we need to inovke this Constructor from beans.xml as follows: 

```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">
  
   
  		      <!-- Definition for cars bean -->
   <bean id = "cars" class = "com.abc.Cars">
       <property name = "tyre" ref = "tyre"/>   
       <!-- because of this property tag, setter method will be called for cars  -->
       
        <constructor-arg   ref = "tyre"/> 
        <!-- because of this constructor-arg tag, constructor will be called for cars  -->
        
   </bean>

   <!-- Definition for tyre bean -->
   <bean id = "tyre" class = "com.abc.Tyre"></bean>
   
   
</beans>

```
