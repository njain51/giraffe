#### Dependency Injection

Consider you have an application which has a text editor component, and you want to provide a spell check. Your normal code without dependency injection would look something like this-

```java
public class TextEditor 
{ 
    private SpellChecker spellChecker; // instance of SpellChecker
    
    public TextEditor() {
      spellChecker = new SpellChecker();
   }
}
```
   
- What we've done here is, create a dependency between the TextEditor and the SpellChecker.

In an inversion of control scenario, we would instead do something like this -  
```java
public class TextEditor {
   private SpellChecker spellChecker;
   
   public TextEditor(SpellChecker spellChecker) {
      this.spellChecker = spellChecker;
   }
}
```

- Here, the TextEditor should not worry about SpellChecker implementation.  
  
- The SpellChecker will be implemented independently and will be passed to the TextEditor at the time of TextEditor instantiation. This entire
  procedure is controlled by the Spring Framework.Here, we have removed total control from the TextEditor and kept it somewhere else (i.e. XML
  configuration file) and the dependency (i.e. class SpellChecker) is being injected into the class TextEditor through a Class Constructor.  
  Thus, the flow of control has been "inverted" by DependencyInjection (DI) because you have effectively delegated dependencies to some external
  system.

- The second method of injecting dependency is through Setter Methods of the TextEditor class where we will create a SpellChecker instance. This
instance will be used to call setter methods to initialize TextEditor's properties.

#### Dependency Injection Type & Description

#####  Constructor-based dependency injection

- Constructor-based DI is accomplished when the container invokes a class constructor with a number of arguments, each representing a dependency on the other class.

#####  Setter-based dependency injection

- Setter-based DI is accomplished by the container calling setter methods on your beans after invoking a no-argument constructor or no-argument static factory method to instantiate your bean.

##### Example: Constructor-based dependency injection  

- Here is the content of TextEditor.java file - package com.abc;

```java
public class TextEditor {
   private SpellChecker spellChecker;

   public TextEditor(SpellChecker spellChecker) {
      System.out.println("Inside TextEditor constructor." );
      this.spellChecker = spellChecker;
   }
   public void spellCheck() {
      spellChecker.checkSpelling();
   }
}
```
Following is the content of another dependent class file SpellChecker.java- package com.abc;

```java
public class SpellChecker {
   public SpellChecker(){
      System.out.println("Inside SpellChecker constructor." );
   }
   public void checkSpelling() {
      System.out.println("Inside checkSpelling." );
   }
}
```

Following is the content of the MainApp.java file-

```java
package com.abc;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class MainApp {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");

      TextEditor te = (TextEditor) context.getBean("textEditor");
      te.spellCheck();
   }
}
```

Following is the configuration file Beans.xml which has configuration for the constructor-based injection -

```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

   <!-- Definition for textEditor bean -->
   <bean id = "textEditor" class = "com.abc.TextEditor">
      <constructor-arg ref = "spellChecker"/>
   </bean>

   <!-- Definition for spellChecker bean -->
   <bean id = "spellChecker" class = "com.abc.SpellChecker"></bean>

</beans>

```

```
Output- 
Inside SpellChecker constructor.
Inside TextEditor constructor. 
Inside checkSpelling.

Explanation: 
1- ClassPathXmlApplicationContext object is created
2-  at same time, it will create bean of TextEditor and SpellChecker class. Since SpellChecker is referenced using constructor-arg so first Constructor of SpellChecker will be called
Note: compiler will create object of that class first whose ref we have given
After SpellChecker object is created then TextEditor Constructor will be executed. 

3- 'te' object will call spellCheck  method further. 

```

#### Constructor arguments resolution-

- There may be an ambiguity while passing arguments to the constructor, in case there are more than one parameters. To resolve this ambiguity, the
  order in which the constructor arguments are defined in a bean definition is the order in which those arguments are supplied to the appropriate
  constructor.

- Consider the following class -

```
package x.y;

public class Test {
   public Test(Car car, Caz caz) {
      // ...
   }
}
```
The following configuration works fine -
```
<beans>
   <bean id = "test" class = "x.y.Test">
      <constructor-arg ref = "car"/>
      <constructor-arg ref = "caz"/>
   </bean>

   <bean id = "car" class = "x.y.Car"/>
   <bean id = "caz" class = "x.y.Caz"/>
</beans>
```

- Let us check one more case where we pass different types to the constructor. Consider the following class -

```
package x.y;

public class Test {
   public Test(int year, String name) {
      // ...
   }
}
```

- The container can also use type matching with simple types, if you explicitly specify the type of the constructor argument using the type attribute. For example -

```

<beans>

   <bean id = "test" class = "x.y.Test">
      <constructor-arg type = "int" value = "2001"/>
      <constructor-arg type = "java.lang.String" value = "Tom"/>
   </bean>

</beans>
```

- One more way to pass constructor arguments, use the index attribute to specify explicitly the index of constructor arguments. Here, the index is 0 based. For example -

```

<beans>

   <bean id = "test" class = "x.y.Test">
      <constructor-arg index = "0" value = "2001"/>
      <constructor-arg index = "1" value = "Tom"/>
   </bean>

</beans>
```

##### Important point- In case you are passing a reference to an object, you need to use ref attribute of <constructor-arg> tag and if you are passing a value directly then you should use value attribute as shown above.
