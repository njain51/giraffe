#### Sample Spring Files: 

1. **Here is the content of HelloWorld.java file:**

```java
package com.abc;

public class HelloWorld {
   private String message;

   public void setMessage(String message){
      this.message  = message;
   }
   public void getMessage(){
      System.out.println("Your Message : " + message);
   }
}
```

2. **content of the second file MainApp.java**

```java
package com.abc;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class MainApp {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
      HelloWorld obj = (HelloWorld) context.getBean("helloWorld");
      obj.getMessage();
   }
}
```

Following two important points are to be noted about the main program: 

* The first step is to create an application context where we used framework API **ClassPathXmlApplicationContext().** 
  
* This API loads beans configuration file and eventually based on the provided API, it takes care of creating and initializing all the objects, i.e. beans mentioned in the configuration file.

* The second step is used to get the required bean using getBean() method of the created context. 
* This method uses bean ID to return a generic object, which finally can be casted to the actual object. 
* Once you have an object, you can use this object to call any class method

3. **Create Bean Configuration File**

- You need to create a Bean Configuration file which is an XML file and acts as a cement that glues the beans, i.e. the classes together. This file
  needs to be created under the src directory


```xml
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
   xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation = "http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

   <bean id = "helloWorld" class = "com.abc.HelloWorld" >
      <property name = "message" value = "Hello World! 1"/>
      
   </bean>

</beans>
```

-  Usually developers name this file as Beans.xml, but you are independent to choose any name you like. 

-  You have to make sure that this file is available in CLASSPATH and use the same name in the main application while creating an application context
   as shown in MainApp.java file.

-  The Beans.xml is used to assign unique IDs to different beans and to control the creation of objects with different values without impacting any of
   the Spring source files.

-  For example, using the following file you can pass any value for "message" variable and you can print different values of message without impacting
   HelloWorld.java and MainApp.java files. Let us see how it works

- When Spring application gets loaded into the memory, Framework makes use of the above configuration file to create all the beans defined and assigns them a unique ID as defined in <bean> tag. You can use <property> tag to pass the values of different variables used at the time of object creation.
