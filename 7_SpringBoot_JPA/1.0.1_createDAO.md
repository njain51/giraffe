# DAO layer

- create a package `dao` and create interface CourseDao in it. 
- this interface will extends JpaRepository<Course,Long> \
- above we're adding  `Course` as Type of Object since its defined as entity and `Long` is primary key in entity class
- Next we need to write implementation in Service class - CourseServiceImpl.java
- we need to get CourseDao object here 
-
